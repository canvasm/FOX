/**
 * @mainpage Janrain Engage for iOS, version 2
 *
 * <a href="http://rpxnow.com/docs/iphone">
 * The Janrain Engage for iOS SDK</a> makes it easy to include third party authentication and
 * social publishing in your iPhone or iPad applications.  This Objective-C library includes the same key
 * features as our web version, as well as additional features created specifically for the mobile
 * platform. With as few as three lines of code, you can authenticate your users with their
 * accounts on Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, etc., and they can immediately publish their
 * activities to multiple social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace,
 * and Yahoo, through one simple interface.
 *
 * Beyond authentication and social sharing, the latest release of the Engage for iOS SDK
 * now allows mobile apps to:
 *   - Share content, activities, game scores or invitations via Email or SMS
 *   - Customize the login experience by displaying native and social login options on the same screen
 *   - Track popularity and click through rates on various links included in the
 *     shared email message with automatic URL shortening for up to 5 URLs
 *   - Provide an additional level of security with forced re-authentication when
 *     users are about to make a purchase or conduct a sensitive transaction
 *   - Configure and maintain separate lists of providers for mobile and web apps
 *   - Match the look and feel of the iPhone or iPad app with customizable background colors,
 *     images, and navigation bar tints
 *
 * Before you begin, you need to have created a
 * <a href="https://rpxnow.com/signup_createapp_plus">Janrain Engage application</a>,
 * which you can do on <a href="http://rpxnow.com">http://rpxnow.com</a>
 *
 * For an overview of how the library works and how you can take advantage of the library's
 * features, please see the <a href="http://rpxnow.com/docs/iphone#user_experience">"Overview"</a>
 * section of our documentation.
 *
 * To begin using the SDK, please see the
 * <a href="http://rpxnow.com/docs/iphone#quick">"Quick Start Guide"</a>.
 *
 * For more detailed documentation of the library's API, you can use
 * the <a href="http://rpxnow.com/docs/iphone_api/annotated.html">"JREngage API"</a> documentation.

/* Preprocessor directive that conditionally compiles the code that uses the weakly-linked MessageUI.Framework.
 This framework is required if you want to include the ability to share activities with email or sms.  By default
 the JRENGAGE_INCLUDE_EMAIL_SMS flag should always be set to "1", which can cause errors with the linker if the
 framework isn't included, but I figured most apps would want the email and sms sharing ability.  If you don't want
 to add the MessageUI.Framework to one or more of your apps that use the JREngage library, you don't have to change
 this value to "0" (which could cause merging issues if I make changes later).

 Instead, if you want to override this setting, you need to add the preprocessor flag "OVERRIDE_INCLUDE_EMAIL_SMS"
 to your target's GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS build setting (also listed as "Preprocessor Macros" under the
 "GCC 4.2 - Preprocessing" heading). */

/**
 * @brief
 * Main API for interacting with the Janrain Engage for iOS library
 *
 * If you wish to include 3rd-Party Authentication and Social Publishing in your iPhone or iPad
 * applications, you can use the JREngage class to achieve this.  Prior to using the JREngage
 * library, you must already have an application on <a href="http://rpxnow.com">http://rpxnow.com</a>.
 * This is all that is required for basic authentication, although some providers may require extra
 * configuration (which can be done through your application's <a href="http://rpxnow.com/relying_parties">Dashboard</a>
 * For social publishing, you will need to configure your rpxnow application with the desired providers.
 *
 * If desired, you can optionally implement server-side authentication<span class="footnote">*</span>.
 * When provided, the JREngage library can post the user's authentication token to a url on your server:
 * the token url.  Your server can complete authentication, access more of JREngage's API, log the authentication, etc.
 * and the server's response will be passed back through to your iOS application.
 *
 * <span class="footnote">*</span>In the previous version of the Engage for iOS library, implementing token url that
 * completed server-side authentication was required. This is no longer the case, although you can optionally implement
 * the token url if you wish to continue authentication on your server.
